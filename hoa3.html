        <h1>Homeowner Tips</h1>
        <p>
          Now that summer is here, it is time to walk through your yard and
          assess what needs to be done before or during fall. This includes your
          yard and the outside of your home and any other buildings. Many of our
          homes are now over 20 years old and some are showing their age.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Outdoor Home Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          Simple things to improve the appearance are:
          <br /><br />
          <!-- <p> -->
          <em>Painting the foundation.</em> The best choice is paint designated
          as masonry/stucco paint. Be sure to remove all existing loose paint in
          order to ensure the new paint has something to adhere to, or you'll be
          painting it all again next year. You may need two coats to cover the
          area uniformly. No ARB request is needed to paint the foundation the
          same color.<br /><br />

          <em>​Power Washing.</em>
          Many of our homes have areas that see very little sun and without sun
          to keep the area dry, mold and other dirt build up. Mold is actually
          harmful to your siding so removing it extends the life. Power washing
          is actually "kinda fun" and you may find members of your family
          wanting to take their turn at it.<br /><br /><em
            >Trimming trees/bushes/shrubs.</em
          >
          ​ Nature has a way of ensuring plants keep growing. While we love our
          shade and blooming flowers, the bigger they grow the less house we
          see. In addition, pests love when our plants grow and spread. Experts
          say that bushes and trees should not touch the house as that
          encourages those nasty pests (bugs).<br />
        </p>

        <hr class="line" />
        <h2>Yard Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          ​​​Fall is the time to prepare the lawn for spring. Many of our
          homeowners are spending hours in the yard to get it ready to look good
          in April. The weather is much better now (mostly) making it easier to
          spend the needed time outdoors. If you need help to determine what
          needs to be done, any area nursery will be happy to provide the step
          by step information on what needs to go down in what order. That
          includes grass seed, fertilizer, new dirt or compost and when to
          water. Yard work takes time so don't expect to be finished in one
          weekend.<br /><br />
          ​No matter who you are be sure to use plenty of sunscreen and wear a
          hat. Make sure you drink plenty of liquids while working.

              If you live at the end of any of our cul-de-sacs, you should know
              that parking any vehicle in a manor which impedes the flow of
              traffic is a traffic offense and you can be given a ticket.
              Impeding the flow in this case should be interpreted as any
              vehicle which prevents another vehicle from turning around at the
              end of the cul-de-sac without having to back up . This is
              particularly important for fire trucks and ambulances where
              seconds count. Please be considerate of your neighbors when
              parking.

              If you are new to Prince William County you may not be aware of
              the laws regarding the responsibilities of dog ownership. Dog
              owners and non dog owners have equal rights. Dog owners have the
              right and expectation that they are able to walk their dog(s). Non
              dog owners have the right to expect that their PRIVATE PROPERTY is
              not used as a "bathroom" for your dog(s). Private property should
              be considered as any property on which the homeowner pays property
              taxes and includes both sides of the sidewalk. Non dog owners also
              have the right to dig, plant, and landscape all of their property
              without fear of touching disease filled dog excrement or urine.
              The information provided below has been copied directly from the
              PWC website. PET OWNER RESPONSIBILITY AND COUNTY ANIMAL CONTROL
              LAWS Pet owners who do not pick up after their pets and pet owners
              that allow their dogs to roam at large are in violation of Prince
              William County Animal Control Laws. The key to address these
              violations is for the person who eye witnesses the act of a pet
              owner being irresponsible with regard to the county animal control
              laws, to contact the Prince William County non-emergency police
              number at (703) 792-6500 to report this violation. The police, in
              turn, will relay this information to the Prince William County
              Animal Warden. The Prince William County Animal Control Bureau
              located at 14807 Dumfries Road, Manassas, VA 20112, (703)
              792-6465, has published a pamphlet entitled Animal Laws and
              General Information. Three specific animal control laws cited in
              this pamphlet are listed below. DID YOU KNOW THAT IN PRINCE
              WILLIAM COUNTY IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO: *** Allow within the
              county prolonged or intense barking or other harsh or excessive
              noises to be made by animals and pets under one’s ownership, at
              any time (Section 14-5.1); and ***Allow your animal to run at
              large within the County unless engaged in supervised, formal
              obedience training classes, or show, or during formally sanctioned
              field trials or while engaged in lawful hunting during open
              hunting season (Section 4-23); and ***Allow your animal to urinate
              or defecate on private property of other persons or on publicly
              owned property except parts of parks as posted as dog run areas
              (Section 4-11 & 4-46). Although dog owner responsibility is the
              most frequently asked about issue with regard to pet control laws,
              occasionally someone will have a question regarding cats. There is
              no leash law for cats, but the county does have a provision for
              county residents to request that ‘No Trespassing’ papers be served
              on a cat owner to prohibit trespassing by his or her cat. The
              Prince William Animal Control Bureau at (703) 792-6465 will be
              able to give you information on this process. ​ Other Noteworthy
              Information: Pet Waste Affects Water Quality ​You can make a
              difference! By Nancy Berlin-- ​Natural Resource Specialist/Master
              Gardener Coordinator Virginia Cooperative Extension - Prince
              William County
              -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Every time it rains, thousands of pounds of pet waste wash down
              storm drains into streams, rivers and lakes and the Chesapeake
              Bay. If left to decay on sidewalks or grass, and not disposed of
              properly, pet waste flows directly into nearby streams and creeks
              without being treated at wastewater treatment facilities. ​When
              pet waste is disposed of improperly, water quality isn't the only
              thing that suffers - your health may be at risk, too. Adults
              working in their gardens, children playing outside and family pets
              are the most at risk for infection from some of the bacteria and
              parasites found in pet waste. When pet waste is left to decay on
              sidewalks or grass near the street, it may be washed into storm
              drains, which drain directly into our waterways. Pet waste then
              decays, using up oxygen, releasing ammonia, and encouraging weed
              and algae growth. All these mean trouble for water quality and
              fish. When citizens understand the problems of pet waste, they can
              work together to remove the threat and nuisance. Most communities
              have "pooper scooper" law, check your homeowner association for
              regulations. How you can make a difference in your community: ​ *
              Pick up pet waste in your yard. It is not a fertilizer. ​ * Carry
              disposable bags with you when you walk your dog. When you dispose
              of the waste, wrap it carefully to avoid spilling, and ​ ensure
              you place it in the proper trash receptacle. ​ * Flush it down the
              toilet where it will go to a sewage treatment plant. Don't flush
              debris or cat litter that can cause plumbing ​ problems. Secure
              used cat litter in a plastic bag for the trash. ​ * Bury it in a
              hole or trench, at least 12 inches deep away from gardens, wells
              and water source and cover with at least eight inches of ​ soil to
              let it decompose slowly. ​ * Don't add it to your compost pile as
              most piles do not get hot enough to "cook" the bacteria. ​ *
              Contact your HOA or local parks to inquire about providing pet
              waste stations in area parks, along trails and in public places
              where ​ people frequently walk their dogs.
